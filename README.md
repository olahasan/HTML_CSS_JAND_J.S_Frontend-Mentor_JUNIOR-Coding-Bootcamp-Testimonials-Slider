## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will be a nice test if you're new to JavaScript. It's also a great opportunity to play around with content animations and transitions.

Your users should be able to:

- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

## Features

- Responsive design
- Smooth transitions between testimonials
- Lazy loading for images
